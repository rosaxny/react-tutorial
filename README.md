## Notes
 - Binding
   - class methods do not automatically bind `this` to class instance
   - bind in constructor or in render
     - avoid binding in render because it will bind every time render runs (think about performance)
   - ES6 arrow functions `() => {}` can automatically bind class methods without explicit binding
 - Controlled Components
   - Uncontrolled Components: 
     - Form elements `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` have own states
     - values are modified internally when changed from the outside
 - Component Declaration
   - Functional Stateless Components
     - input: props
     - output: component instance (JSX)
     - no local state (stateless)
       - no `this` object
       - cannot access or update state with `this.state` or `this.setState()`
     - no lifecycle methods, e.g. `constructor()`, `render()`
   - ES6 Class Components
     - extends from React component
     - has lifecycle methods
     - can store and manipulate state
   - React.createClass()
     - deprecated
